# City Plants Partner and Grant Maps
This repository includes code in R to create custom maps for City Plants to be used in tree inventory and database. Existing versions of grant and nonprofit partner areas are currently analog or hand-drawn in Google Maps. For this project I create two "flattened" maps. One that ensures all of Los Angeles has one and only one partner assigned to that area. The other is based on grant prioritization, removing any overlapping areas.
